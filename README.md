# C- (C Minus) Language Concept

C- would be a hypothetical programming language that aims to combine the low-level control of C with some of the modern features of C#. Here's a conceptual overview:

## Core Characteristics:
1. Low-level memory management like C
2. Direct hardware access capabilities
3. Garbage collection (optional, can be turned off for performance-critical sections)
4. Modern syntax inspired by C#

## Key Features:
- Pointers and manual memory management
- Structs and unions
- LINQ-like query expressions for arrays and other collections
- Properties and events
- Simplified asynchronous programming model
- Operator overloading
- Preprocessor directives (like C) but with more modern metaprogramming capabilities

## Example Syntax:

```c-
#include <stdio.h>

struct Person {
    char* name;
    int age;
    
    property int BirthYear {
        get => 2024 - this.age;
    }
}

int main() {
    Person* p = malloc(sizeof(Person));
    p->name = "Alice";
    p->age = 30;
    
    printf("Name: %s, Age: %d, Birth Year: %d\n", p->name, p->age, p->BirthYear);
    
    free(p);
    return 0;
}
```

This language concept combines C's low-level capabilities with some of C#'s ease of use, creating a unique and potentially powerful (albeit hypothetical) programming language.
